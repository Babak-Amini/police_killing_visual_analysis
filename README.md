This data is provided by the Bureau of Justice Statistics along with the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics. The belief is that locking away criminals with minimum sentencing has decreased violent crime since the 1980s. Therefore, the question is, are these high incarceration rates good for stopping crime, or are they counter productive? In the United States, one quarter of global prisoners are housed. This is obviously a high percentage given the United States is 4% of the global population.

In these datasets, we are looking at how violent crime relates to incarceration and police shootings. This is sparking interest as the death of George Floyd has come about. There are many different factors to study, but instead of making this political, the goal of these datasets is to see correlations between locking people in prison and if states with greater incarceration are incarcerating for violence or not. Additionally, are the states with more violence the states where there are a disproportionate number of police shootings? These questions have been on the public's mind for several years now, as the news media continues to spark outrage of police brutality.
